# Cupcakes & Coding
Cupcakes &amp; Coding is a safe place to talk about your programming struggles

Cupcakes & Coding is a safe place to learn programming, from absolute “know-nothing” beginners to seasoned developers. Each week, someone shares knowledge by leading a tutorial showcasing a useful computational skill. Most presenters have 6 month < x < 2 years coding experience, and 30% started with no knowledge of programming at all before Cupcakes & Coding.

Past presentations included: 
- Basic introduction to de novo sequence assembly of genomes or transcripts from NGS data
- Automating FACS plots using R and ggplot2
- A beginners guide to protein visualization using PyMOL, a versatile and open-source molecular graphics environment
- Introduction to deep learning

The presentations are hands-on, interactive coding sessions where we all learn together! 

All are welcome, regardless of programming experience, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Yes, there will be cupcakes from La Luna Cupcakes :)
